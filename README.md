# experimental-evaluation-sort-algos
This project aims to conduct an experiment and evaluate the time complexity metrics of the following sorting algorithms for each different input characteristic.  

There are five different input characterisitic:

Sorted,
Reverse sorted,
Almost sorted,
Duplicate,
Random.

The following sorting techniques are coded by us before the experiment:

Insertion Sort
Binary Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Quick Sort with Median of 3 Optimization
Heap Sort
Counting Sort


Then, for each algoritmh, data sets representing each input characteristic were run. 
Finally, their sorting performance and relative comparison for each combination were meticulously investigated by us in the project report.
